# Open Set Emotion Recognition
Emotion recognition methods often categorize emotional expressions into distinct categories (sadness, happiness). However, there is a wide variety of expressive behaviors that might not be emotional (yawning) or might be ambiguous (mixed emotions). The goal of this project is to build a multimodal emotion recognition model that can use uncertainty of estimation to assign a sample to an unknown or other class.
